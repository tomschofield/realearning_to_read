However minimal its importance, a sequence, since it is
made up of a snnll number of nuclei (that is to say, in fact,
of ‘dixpatchen’), always involves moments of risk and it
is this which justiﬁes analysing it. It might seem futile to
constitute into a sequence the logical succession of triﬂing
acts which go to nuke up the oﬂer of a cigarette (oﬂering,
accepting, lighting, smoking), but precisely, at every one of
these points, an alternative — and hence a freedom of mean-
ing - is possible. Du Pont, Bond's future partner, oﬂers
him a light from his lighter but Bond refuses; the meaning
of this bifurcation is that Bond instinctively fears a booby-

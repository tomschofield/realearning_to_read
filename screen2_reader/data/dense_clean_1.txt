logic which structures a sequence is inextricably linked to its
name; any function which initiates a seduction. prescribes
from the moment it appears, in the name to which it gives
rise, the entire process of seduction such as we have learned
it from all the narratives which have fashioned in us the
language of narrative.

However minimal its importance, a sequence, since it is
made up of a small number of nuclei (that is to say, in fact,
of ‘dispatchers’), always involves moments of risk and it
is this which justiﬁes analysing it. It might seem futile to
constitute into a sequence the logical succession of triﬂing
acts which go to make up the offer of a cigarette (oﬂeriizg,

him a light from his lighter but Bond refuses; the meaning
of this bifurcation is that Bond instinctively fears a booby-
